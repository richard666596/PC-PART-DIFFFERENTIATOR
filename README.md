## The Algorithm

By using ImageNet and using my own classifications labels and dataset, it is able to differentiate between common pc parts such as a gpu or camera. 

## Running this project

1. first you need to download the following libraries(jetson_inference, jetson_utils, argparse, onnx, sys, os, csv, glob, torch, numpy, Image, random, time, shutil, warnings, datetime, voc, nuswide, reshape, xml.dom.minidom, PIL)
2. then download a test image and type (python3 project.py test.jpg)
3. it should run and return the classification and percentage of confidence
